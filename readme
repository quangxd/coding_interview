//Explain whether you would use a separate structure to mark visited cells and justify your choice.

No extra space for visited: Since we are marking visited cells directly in the grid by changing the values of the 1s to 0s,
there is no need to allocate additional space for tracking visited cells. The grid itself holds this information.
